        last year i heard of an opportunity to play steel pan in trinidad &
        tobago, my dad's home country, at their national academy of performing
        arts [NAPA]. i love playing pan, so i decided to apply to learn from the
        world-wide best. it's december 27th, i'm on a ferry to tobago, i've been
        here for 5 days now. my goal is to experience as much as i can within
        these few months; here are some of those experiences.
