{"title":"Wild Mountain Thyme","artist":"John McDermott","date":"2023.07.06","description":"this song was the announcement of project dandelion and represents the start of the project. i used this song as the start for many reasons. a big part of it is i simply find the song to be incredibly hopeful and joy-filled. this song has inspired me throughout my music career, and its lyrics promotes a general sense of community. i thought it fit the vibe of this project quite nicely and was a good way to kick it off.\r\n\r\ntraditionally, this song is quite slow-paced and beautiful, focused on harmony and the message of the song itself. however john mdermott's rendition is much more fast-paced, which shocked me when i first heard it, but i love the inherent message in his version. fuck tradition, innovate. that's the message i get when i hear his song, and that spirit jives perfectly with the spirit of project dandelion itself.","type":"Dandelion","filenames":["2023.07.06_0-0.jpg","2023.07.06_0-1.jpg","2023.07.06_0-2.jpg","2023.07.06_0-3.jpg","2023.07.06_0-4.jpg","2023.07.06_0-5.jpg","2023.07.06_0-6.jpg","2023.07.06_0-7.jpg","2023.07.06_0-8.jpg","2023.07.06_0-9.jpg"],"timestamp":1707169067819,"status":"in database","_id":"0PBNe6tRx3QLyw1m"}

{"title":"after prelim's","location":"Glencoe, Port of Spain","date":"2024.01.23","post":"alrighty guys, lots has happened since the last update. lets start with pan.\n\ni've been playing with all stars every night, and i'm loving it. it's a very welcoming environment and i've made a few connections with both kids my age and older people with more experience and skills. two days ago was preliminary judging for panorama and it was so much fun. the song is sounding really good and there is a lot of deconstructing and reimaginning different aspects of it. so far i'm a very big fan of the arrangement by leon edwards, who will be one of my professors once school starts. after prelim's, they change bits of the song and add parts and take away parts so the whole movement is constantly dynamic which is a lot of fun for me. they will make it different for semi's and again for finals, and that's the stage that we are in now -- preparing for semi's. i'm consistently challenged and nowhere near the top of the musical food chain here which is a really nice change of pace.\n\ni find myself sleeping a lot at the moment. i'm exhausted from practice because i'm spending close to seven hours a night at the panyard and getting home around 3:30 relatively consistently. once school starts up i always find it easier to wake up since there's a more structured routine. speaking of, i'm getting ready for school right now. two of my classes have already started [carnival immersion and internship]. the immersion course for now is just immersing myself in the pan community and panorama experience and taking notes on what is going on around me. the internships that i've chosen will not start until after the panorama/carnival season but i have planned them out. i'll be working with pan notation [a wealth of pan knowledge on an online portal that also facilitates building and purchasing of pan music scores], with agustus peters [trincan's pan tuner/manufacturer] and possibly with a new comittee dedicated to defining pan around the world. so lot's to be excited about in the future.\n\nbeing away from everybody is getting easier by the day. i find it still easy to connect with people even though i cannot be with them physically. new connections i'm making here is also making it easier to not feel lonely. i'm sinking into a nice vibe here, definitely still need to set a few things up (my new room's snack stash most importantly -- i'm gonna need to find me a milk crate). i also am hoping to find a doubles man near school, and a guy near home. the dogs are also helping this place feel a lot more like home, it's nice to have some friends out the back anytime i want to hang out.\n\nanyways, that's pretty much the vibe for right now. i'm learning a lot about full web development -- currently working on the back-end server, database, and processes -- and i'm hoping to get the website done before i start school. there definitely will be more improvements to come the more i learn [comments on posts, posts from you, etc. (holy shit wait i'm basically just making a social media app)]. i'll keep you updated on life down here.","type":"Blog","timestamp":1706383541944,"status":"in database","_id":"8e3HCuqi9HHfozsP"}
{"title":"Carlo's Song","artist":"Noah Kahan","date":"2023.07.12","description":"with this song i wanted to set the pace/vibe for the rest of the project. this post was meant to give a little insight into my life, the types of things that i like doing, and my music taste. it was a very simple post with a simple caption: \"good song to play in an echo-y parking garage.\"\r\n\r\nthe song itself, by noah kahan, is a folk-alternative song which is a lot of the music that i listen to. the picture i posted alongside it was of a sunset at lake wabamun from a summer trip with my friends. those two things, along with the picture that the caption paints is meant to set a laid-back tone for the rest of the project.\r\n","type":"Dandelion","filenames":["2023.07.12_0-0.jpg"],"timestamp":1707073776316,"status":"in database","_id":"CzwGfzy3b62ZuXJ0"}
{"title":"The Panorama Experience","location":"UTT NAPA Campus, Port of Spain","date":"2024.04.26","post":"okay so panorama was an absolutely incredible, life-changing experience. no joke. like my life genuinely is different now than it was before. the people i've met at all stars and the things i've learnt will stay with me forever. that feeling on the stage -- i'll be chasing that my whole life.\n\nnow i don't want to go too into detail here, but i wrote a personal reflection on the entire experience, and i'll put the link to that here so you can find it if you are curious about it.\r\n\r\nbut here's the important bits: its exhilarating, all of it. the music is so complex and beautiful and it truly is an incredible form of art. these arrangers take creativity to another level, and pannists are some of the most dedicated people i've ever met. i find it difficult to believe i won't be back again.. very soon.","type":"Blog","filenames":[],"timestamp":1714162280548,"status":"in database","_id":"G4KrHEaaNjamUayZ"}

{"title":"first update","location":"Glencoe, Port of Spain","date":"2024.01.11","post":"i've been here for just about 3 weeks now. my family left two days ago and to be honest i'm enjoying the space. i've realized that i cannot be trapped in close confinement for over 4-5 days with a lot of people. two christmases ago i got extremely sick in canmore, same thing in london the following summer. when we got here, for over 3 weeks straight, it was non-stop moving and action and people. we rolled around the country with a squad of 15 people; from san fernando to tobago to port of spain to gaspar grande and back to south. i had so much fun, but i've come to realize about myself that i need time to myself daily, i need silence and privacy and darkness.\n\ni've committed to playing steelpan with trinidad all stars for panorama. there was a few days that i was set on playing with the renegades, and their arranger, duvone stewart, tried his best to make it work but they were overfull on their limit of people. i like all stars' song better [inventor by olatunji], but i would have really liked to work under duvone (he's a musical genius and just good vibes). at all stars i'm playing an \"all stars tenor\", a different layout for the pan, which means the notes are not in the places i'm used to and i'm basically learning a completely new instrument. it has presented a nice challenge, and i'm slowly getting the hang of it. one thing i notice about trinidad pan vs pan back home is that there are less chords for tenor, but way more runs. they really deconstruct the songs here and add their own spins to them, which i like a lot. i'm having lots of fun playing at all stars, and i love that we practice outside under the stars.\n\ni'm driving my grandma's old car and i love driving here. it is a driving experience that reminds me of kenya. and there are lots of hills which i love, some so steep that i worry the car will not make it to the top, but it always does. i'm getting the hang of right-side drive and it feels natural now. i now just need to learn the roads and lay of the land of port of spain, which will come with time driving and living here. so far so good.\n\ni still miss my friends a lot. and i also miss having a piano and a guitar, maybe i should look into renting a guitar for six months. i'm still very much in contact with lots of my friends through text, facetime and instagram. having lots of things to do here helps keep my mind off of missing people back home. i find listening to the music i listen to at home helps me feel better and like my people are around me always.\n\nschool has been going well, i've mapped out the internship credits that i'm going to be doing and got to see the pan room that i'll be spending lots of time in. no true course work has started yet but the info sessions that we have had made me very excited for what is to come.","type":"Blog","timestamp":1706383510647,"status":"in database","_id":"P9bVaQ7xAgcBNDlo"}

{"title":"pilot","location":"Buccoo, Tobago","date":"2023.12.28","post":"okay. welcome to my blog. here's the current situation:\n\ni'm in tobago, in an airbnb. today we went to store bay to body-surf on the beach, eat crab & dumplings, and play spikeball. then we went to see some land my grandpa bought a few years back in hopes of building a rental house ontop of it. i'm unfamiliar with this island -- i've only been here once before and i was so young i don't remember it. we are driving around a sick company truck; it's a 5-speed diesel with a bench in the front, a constantly-falling-off window roller in the back, and, of course, it's a right-side drive. so much fun. i'm enjoying tobago so far, it's small and sweet and everyone knows each other. and fireworks go off every single night for seemingly no reason (maybe christmas/new years but fuck that i'd rather think they are for nothing).\n\nit was nice being back in trindad. i landed on a saturday, bright and early at 6:11, and immediately went on a doubles run with my dad and got a haircut. we had christmas dinner at grandma's house in san fernando which was a nice way of remembering her. yesterday i got a sneak-peek at my uncle's new port-of-spain house where i will be staying for the coming months, but other than that i have yet to see north at all. i'm very excited for this adventure.\n\nnow the not-so-fun stuff to talk and think about. i've been missing my friends a lot, and the thought of this going on for many more months hurts. i feel like i will be missing out on so much while i'm here and am scared in the smallest sense that when i reach back home i'll be forgotten. i've barely been sleeping because im up on facetime trying to keep my connections strong, but as of right now it simply sucks. the bad thoughts only come out night though so it's manageable.\n\nthat's pretty much it right now. i start school on the 3rd so until then i'm in vacation mode. i'll keep you updated.","type":"Blog","timestamp":1706383380277,"status":"in database","_id":"vaTMF9t0XoEnUyjA"}
