# 🌴 My Creative Hub

A personal website that brings together my life, music, and code. It’s part blog, part portfolio, part audio diary  a digital space that reflects who I am and what I create.

## Overview

This site is a mix of reflection, exploration, and expression. Here's what you'll find:

### 🇹🇹 **Blog: Life in Trinidad**
A collection of blog posts capturing my time studying steelpan at the University of Trinidad and Tobago — the culture, the music, the vibes, and the journey. Unfortunately, during my time in Trinidad, I was so focused on school that I never actually kept up with the blog.

### 🌼 **Project Dandelion**
Inspired by the beauty of connection, Project Dandelion is an Instagram-based project where I share **songs** instead of pictures — each one tied to a memory, a feeling, or a moment from my life.

> It's like a musical photo album, built track by track.

### 🎶 **Musical Works** *(Coming Soon)*
A space dedicated to my own music — whether it’s steelpan performances, arrangements, compositions, or otherwise.

### 💻 **Coding Projects** *(Coming Soon)*
A growing portfolio of projects I'm working on or have built, showing my journey as a developer, creator, and builder.

### 📄 **Resume** *(Coming Soon)*
A downloadable and interactive version of my resumes — perfect for sharing with collaborators, employers, or anyone curious about my work, skills, and experiences.
